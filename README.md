# RIP

This is a HTTP load testing and UDP flood attack tool that run requests concurrently.

Note: I am using this project as a Go learning project. Refactors will most likely happen often.

Looking for new features? Create an issue.

![RIP](./rip.gif)

## Features

-   HTTP load testing
-   UDP flood attack
-   Run requests concurrently
-   Set a timer in second for how long it should run
-   Outputs table of statistics for the end result
-   Log the requests to $HOME/rip.log
-   Supports multiple hosts
-   POST/PUT/PATCH HTTP requests
-   HTTP JSON payload

## Coming

-   UDP payload attachment
-   Form data payload
-   Custom HTTP headers
-   JSON output of the result

## Usage

Install the binary from <https://github.com/bjarneo/rip/releases>, or go directly to the build the binary manually step.

```bash
#### Standard by using one host
rip -concurrent 100 -interval 10 https://your.domain.com

#### Multiple hosts
touch hosts.txt

# Add the content, important that each host is on a newline
http://localhost:5000
http://localhost:5000/dis-is-nice
http://localhost:5000/yas

# RIP
rip -interval 10 -hosts hosts.txt

#### Using UDP flood attack
rip -interval 10 -concurrent 10 -udp -udp-bytes 4096 0.0.0.0:30000

#### Using a JSON payload for POST requests
rip -interval 10 -concurrent 10 -post -json payload.json http://localhost:5000/login

#### Example using custom headers
touch headers.txt

# Add the content
X-Real-Ip: 192.168.0.1
Authorization: Basic aGV5OnlvdQo=

# RIP
rip -interval 10 -concurrent 10 -headers headers.txt http://localhost:5000
```

### The default values

```bash
Usage of RIP
  -concurrent int
    	How many concurrent users to simulate (default 10)
  -hosts string
    	A file of hosts. Each host should be on a new line. It will randomly choose a host. (default "")
 -headers string
    	Path to the headers file (default "")
  -interval int
    	How many seconds to run the test (default 60)
  -json string
    	Path to the JSON payload file to be used for the HTTP requests (default "")
  -logger bool
    	Log the requests to $HOME/rip.log (default false)
  -patch bool
    	PATCH HTTP request (default false)
  -post bool
    	POST HTTP request (default false)
  -put bool
    	PUT HTTP request (default false)
  -udp bool
    	Run requests UDP flood attack and not http requests (default false)
  -udp-bytes int
    	Set the x bytes for the UDP flood attack (default 2048)


```

## Get it up and running [DEV]

```bash
# Install dependencies
go install

# By using the go binary directly
go run main.go
```

## Build the binary manually

To use the bleeding edge codebase, this is the way.

```bash
# Build binary
go build

# Now it will be available as "rip"
rip http://localhost:1337
```

## Troubleshooting

If you get this error message `socket: too many open files`, you might want to increase your ulimit to a higher number.

```bash
ulimit -n 12000
```
